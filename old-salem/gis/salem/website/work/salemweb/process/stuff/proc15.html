      <h4>15. Final Checks: Local Area Input</h4>

      <p>Before transforming the data, we have sought further help from Tom O'Leary 

        in the GIS & Mapping Office of the Essex County Registry of Deeds. </p>

      <p>At the beginning stage of our research, Mr. O'Leary had provided us with 

        sample coordinates for a few points . He identified the Putnam Family 

        Cemetery for us, which, because of it's obscure location, would have been 

        impossible for we who are not familiar with the area. Brown explains that 

        the cemetery is "located off a small asphalt path which begins at the 

        entrance road to the Massachusetts Department of Public Works on Route 

        62, just west of its intersection with Route 1" (Brown, 103). On the aerials, 

        the site looks like this: </p>

      <p><img src="images/screen15a.gif" width="485" height="461"></p>

      <p>It would have been difficult for us, located in Charlottesville, Virginia, 

        to obtain these coordinates without having a partner in Essex County who 

        could ascertain "ground truth."</p>

      <p>Because of his facility and willingness to help, we have again engaged 

        Tom O'Leary to provide us with coordinates for the sites in the address 

        matched and GNIS point coverages. This is duplicating efforts, but it 

        is not wasting them: with O'Leary's help, we will be able to double-check 

        the location of points that we had previously eyeballed. We are confident 

        that this will help us maintain a higher degree of locational accuracy 

        for those existing sites than would otherwise be possible. </p>
