      <h4> 3. About GIS Data</h4>

      <p><b><i>Q.</i></b><i> Why use GIS software, which is designed to create 

        highly accurate models of the geographic world, to model a printed map 

        of doubtful accuracy? </i> </p>

      <p><b><i>A.</i></b><i> Because GIS software provides us with a way to visualize 

        data stored in a relational database system. This gives us more powerful 

        analytic tools than is typically brought to bear on historical materials, 

        and certainly on this subject.</i></p>

      <p>GIS software was first developed by the Canadian government in the 1960s 

        to inventory the vast land holdings across that nation. They needed a 

        highly accurate way of automating information tied to geography. In recent 

        years, GIS has grown rapidly and tremendously. It's major users are still 

        those who manage or survey physical features and infrastructures: engineers, 

        scientists, governments, facilities coordinators. GIS allows these users 

        to visually organize and spatially query vast amounts of data to answer 

        questions more rapidly and readily. Only recently have historians and 

        social scientists begun to explore the power of GIS to study demography 

        and temporal change in the physical world. </p>

      <p>GIS data typically represents the world through a combination of vector 

        graphics and tabular data, stored as a series of layers. Each layer represents 

        only one type of feature, but may store many instances of that feature, 

        each of which is represented by a record in a "feature attribute table." 

        Features can be represented as points, for discrete features, lines, for 

        linear features, or polygons for area features. </p>

      <p>For example, if you were to model the road network in your hometown, 

        you would probably include a layer that represented the streets. Each 

        line in the layer would correspond to a street, and each line would have 

        information about it--like the name of the street it represents, the addresses 

        on that street--in the associated feature attribute table. If you wanted 

        to show where the stoplights in town were, you might use points to represent 

        this information: each point would overlay on top of the street layer, 

        and should probably correspond to the street intersections. As with the 

        street layer, the intersection layer would have associated information--perhaps 

        each record would include not only the cross streets, but also the last 

        time the lights were replaced at that stoplight. </p>

      <p>The process of creating such GIS data layers from a printed source is 

        called "digitization." Essentially, this involves tracing the points, 

        lines and polygons of a map using the GIS software. To do this, one needs 

        a set of known control points, or "tics" which would be digitized and 

        used to anchor the rest of the digitizing. Without tics, it is difficult 

        to impossible to assign real world latitude and longitude values to the 

        data. </p>

      <p>Once digitized, the GIS layer, or "coverage" can be associated with sets 

        of data recorded in other ways. </p>
