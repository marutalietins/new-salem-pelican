      <h4> 4. Identifying Data to Record from Upham's Map </h4>

      <p>We decided to proceed with digitization of Upham's map on two fronts:</p>

      <ol>

        <li> For demonstration and experimentation purposes, immediately digitize 

          the points of Upham's map. </li>

        <li> Simultaneously research information about existing sites depicted 

          on Upham's map, so that the data created from this map could be matched 

          to other contemporary data about Salem and Essex County, Massachusetts.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>This process is slightly backward from what might usually be done: that 

        is, we might normally have first researched existing sites to obtain a 

        series of known "control points" that could be used to anchor the Upham 

        map as we digitized. However, we recognized that this would take time 

        and effort, and we felt that it would be useful to have a point coverage 

        of Salem available to experiment with, even if it were not "geographically 

        aware," or referenced to a real-world coordinate system. Later, after 

        ascertaining control points we could reassign coordinate systems to the 

        data and "transform" it. This process is not without the potential for 

        error. However, even if it were to produce completely unacceptable results, 

        digitizing Upham's map a second time would not be time consuming. </p>

      <p> The basic data, without true geographic coordinates, will be output 

        to postscript files for use with Macromedia's Generator. This software 

        enables us to produce animations of the first month of Salem, showing 

        where, when, and how quickly the accusations spread throughout the village, 

        and tie these animations to a queryable database. The early results of 

        these experiments with animated databases are <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~cj8n/salem/salem.swf">available 

        for viewing</a>.</p>

      <p>We decided to scan the map at a high resolution and digitize the data 

        from the image. Digitizing from paper sources is potentially more time-consuming 

        and more prone to error because of human fatigue.</p>
