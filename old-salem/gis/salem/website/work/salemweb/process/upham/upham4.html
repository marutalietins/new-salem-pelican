      <h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
      <h4>D. Test Digitization</h4>
            <p>We decided to scan the map at a high resolution and digitize the data 
        from the image. Digitizing from paper sources is potentially more time-consuming 
        and more prone to error because of human fatigue.</p>
      <h5>Locate Temporary TICS on Upham's Map</h5>

      <p>Once the map was scanned, we began by developing a set of temporary tics 

        to anchor future work on the non-referenced data. We chose these tics 

        based on their visibility on the map. When precise points were identified, 

        they would be matched to existing points on Upham's map.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/proc5a.gif" width="598" height="428"></p>

      <h5>Digitizing Points</h5>
      <p> Once the tics were digitized, we proceeded to trace the points, one-by-one. 
        Upham used a mix of Arabic numerals, alphabetical characters, and other 
        glyphs to represent the dwellings and landmarks on his map. To track these 
        point features and link them to other information in our developing database, 
        we assigned our own internal key number to each point: we followed Upham's 
        numeric system at first, then continued sequentially through the non-alphabetical 
        characters, then the alphabetical characters. This process produced 182 
        points. </p>
      <p><img src="../images/proc6a.gif" width="517" height="470"></p>
      <h5>Digitizing Other Features</h5>
      <p>We also digitized major roads, streams and the boundary of Salem Village. 
        Because the location and shape of even natural features can change over 
        the course of 300 years, line features such as streams or roads will not 
        be used to help located contemporary real world sites. Instead, these 
        features are less important for the data they convey than for the visual 
        reference they provide on Upham's map. </p>
