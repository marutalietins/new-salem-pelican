      <h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
      <h4>A. About the Upham Map </h4>

      <p>W.P. Upham, brother to author Charles, researched and drew the map. In 
        his notes to the volume, Charles Upham included some details about how 
        land grants were located and drawn, but is largely silent about how his 
        brother located the dwellings of the major actors in the Salem narrative:</p>
      <blockquote> The map, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey 
        chart, is the result of much personal exploration and perambulation on 
        the ground. It may claim to be a very exact representation of many of 
        the original grants and farms. The locality of these houses, mills, and 
        bridges, in 1692, is given in some cases precisely, and in all with near 
        approximation. The task has been a difficult one. An original plot of 
        Governor Endicott's Ipswich River grant, No. III., is in the State House, 
        and one of the Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem town-books. Neither 
        of them, however, affords elements by which to establish its exact location. 
        A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No. XX., as its boundaries were finally 
        determined, is in the State House, and another of the same in the court-files 
        of the county. This gives one fixed and known point, Hadlock's bridge, 
        from which, following the lines by points of compass and distances, s 
        indicated on the plot and described in the Colonial Records, all the sides 
        of the grant are laid out with accuracy, and its place on the map determined 
        with absolute certainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan 
        of a part of the boundary between Salem and Reading in 1666 is in the 
        State House; of which an exact tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. H.J. 
        Coolidge, of the Secretary of State's office. It gives two of the sides 
        of the Governor Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as to afford 
        the means of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing its locality. 
        There are no other plots of original or early grants or farms on this 
        territory; but, starting from the Bishop and Bellingham grants thus laid 
        out in their respective places, by a collation of deeds of conveyance 
        and partition on record, with the aid of portions of the primitive stone-walls 
        still remaining, and measurements resting on permanent objects, the entire 
        region has been reduced to a demarkation comprehending the whole area. 
        The locations of then-existing roads have been obtained from the returns 
        of laying-out committees, and other evidence in the records and files. 
        The construction of the map, in all its details, is the result of the 
        researches and labors of W. P. Upham.
