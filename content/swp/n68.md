[Abi g: Willi ams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) & [An n Putm an](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) said she told them that she had choakt a woman lately at Boston
[Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) cryed why do you pinch me the mark was visible to the standers by. The Marshall said she pincht her fingers at that time.
[Dorcas Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) why do you hurt these?
I never hurt any child in my life. 
It is you, or your appearance 
How can I help it? 
What is it from you that hurts these? 
I never saw worse than my self 
You need not see worse. They charge you with killing your huband 
I never did, nor never saw you before 
You sent for [Goody Gale](/tag/gale_goody.html) to cut your head off What do you say to that?
I never sent for her upon that account. 
What do you say about killing your husband. 
[Susan: Sheldon](/tag/sheldon_susannah.html) also charged her that she came in with two cats, & brought me the book, & fell into a fit & told me your name was [Goody Bukly](/tag/buckley_sarah.html) .
No, I never did, I never saw thee before. 
What black cats were those you had? 
I had none. 
[Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) , [Susan: Sheldon](/tag/sheldon_susannah.html), & [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) said they saw a black man whispering in her ears.
Oh! you are liars, & God will stop the mouth of liars 
You are not to speak after this manner in the Court 
I will speak the Truth as long as I live. 
[Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) & [Susan: Sheldon](/tag/sheldon_susannah.html) & [Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) said again there was a man whispering in her ear, & said she should never confess.
[Good y Bibb er](/tag/bibber_sara.html) free from fits hitherto said there was a black man with her & fell into a fit.
What do you say to those cats that suckt your breast, what are they? 
I had no cats. 
You do not call them cats, what are they that suck you? 
I never suckt none, but my child. 
What do you say, you never saw [Goody Bukly](/tag/buckley_sarah.html) ?
I never knew her. 
[Goodm: Bukly](/tag/buckley_william.html) testifyed that she had been at the house often.
I know you but not the woman 
You said you did not know the Name. 
Many by-standers testifyed she disowned that she knew the name 
I did not know the name so as to goe to the woman 
[Susan: Sheldon](/tag/sheldon_susannah.html) & Abig: Williams cryed there was a blew bird bird gone into her back.
The Marshall struck, & several of the by-standers testifyed that they saw a fly like a Millar. 
What did you see [goddy Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html). who was looking up [Goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html) was taken dumb.
What can you have no heart to confess. 
I have nothing to do with witchcraft 
They say the Devil is whispering in your ear. 
I cannot help it if they do se it. 
cannot you confess what you think of these things? 
Why should I confess that I do not know. 
[Susan: Sheldon](/tag/sheldon_susannah.html) cryed O [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) do not kill me, & fell into a fit, & when she came to her self she said, she saw a black man whispering in her ear, & she brought me the book.
I have no book, but the Lords book. 
What Lords book. 
The Lords book 
Oh said some of the afflicted there is one whispering in her ears. There is some body will rub your ears shortly, said the examinant Immediately they were afflicted, and among others [Mercy Lewes](/tag/lewis_mercy.html). Why do you threaten they should be Rubb'd?
I did not speak a word of Rubbing. 
Many testifyed she did. 
My meaning was God would bring things to light. 
Your meaning for God to bring the thing to light would be to deliver these poor afflicted ones, that would not Rubb them. 

(Reverse) 
This is unusual impudence to threaten before Authority. who hurts them now. 
I know not. 
They were rubbed after you had threatened them. 
[Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) , [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) & [Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) were carried towards her, but they could not come near her
What is the reason these cannot come near you 
I can not help it, I do them no wrong, they may come if they will Why you see, they cannot come near you 
I do them no wrong 

Note. The afflicted were much distressed 
during her examination. 

This is true account of the Examination 
of [Dorcas Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) without wrong to any party 
according to my original characters from themselves 
at the moments thereof

[John Hale](/tag/hale_john.html) aged 56 yeares Testifieth 6. 7. 1692 That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told concerning [Dorcas Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) her beeing a fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should live poorely so long as her husband [willm Hoar](/tag/hoar_william.html) did live, but the said will should dye before her, & after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of [Ens: Corning](/tag/corning_ens.html) & his wife who should dye.first & that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares agoe the s'd [Dorcas](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life & that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, & their were rules to know what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book & evill art shee seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: whereupon I had great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I discovered  an evillractice had been between a servant of mine & some of s'd [Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) children in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd [Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) . and I had a daughter [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) then between 11 & 12 years old, whome I asked if she knew of the [Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me, & one reason was, she was threatened that [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) was a witch & had a book by w'ch shee could tell what s'd [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) did tell me in my house & if the s'd [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) told me of the stealing, the said [Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) would raise the devill to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said that [Dorcas](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) her selfe or her chilldren told [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) those words I remember not) I asked [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) if she saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book & their were many streaks & pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said [Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) could reveale secretes & work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you of the stealing [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) . But she replyed I know [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) is a witch (or to the effect) & then told storys of strange things that had been acted in or about my house, when I & my wife were abroad to fright s'd [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) into silence about the theft, w'ch s'd [Rebecca](/tag/hale_rebecca.html) judged to be acts of s'd [Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd [Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) had told me of a book of palmstry she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better satisfyed I asked [Thomas Tuck](/tag/tuck_thomas.html) if he knew [Goody Hoar](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) to have a book of fortune telling & he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he had seen w'th streaks & pictures in it and that it was about the bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them w'ch can kill the boady &c.
About those times other things were spoken of the s'd [Hoares](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for his consideration & as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had & [W'm Hoar](/tag/hoar_william.html) answered the book was [John Samsons](/tag/samson_john.html) & his wife had returned the  book long agoe & so the matter was left for that time. When discourses revived of [Goody Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) fortune telling of later times, & she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may things that I had known & heard of her. Shee told me that he owne fortune that she spake of, she was told by a shipmaster when she was first marryed. & [Ens: Corning](/tag/corning_ens.html) fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd [Corning](/tag/corning_ens.html) or his wife: But as I take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill, or any spirit but ones, & that was soon after old [Thomas Tuck](/tag/tuck_thomas.html) dyed (w'ch I take to be about ten yeare since) & that shee took it to be the Ghost of [Thom: tuck](/tag/tuck_thomas.html) coming to speak w'th her about some land s'd [Tuck](/tag/tuck_thomas.html) had told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost & got away.
The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of [John Samsons](/tag/samson_john.html) w'ch he had from her as she said above 20 years agoe & that shee had not told fortunes since the time I had layed before her the evill of it. w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th [John Samson](/tag/samson_john.html) & he told me that he had a book of Palmstry when he lived at [Goody Hoars](/tag/hoar_dorcas.html) w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. & he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since & had not seen it since
