Sometimes alone, and sometimes in company with [Goody Nurse](/tag/nurse_rebecca.html) and [Goody Corey](/tag/corey_martha.html) , and a great many I do not know. -- Then she fell into a fit again. -- Q. [Abigail Williams!](/tag/williams_abigail.html) did you see a company at [Mr. Parris's](/tag/parris_samuel.html) house eat and drink? A. Yes Sir, that was their sacrament. Q. How many were there? A.

[Elizabeth Procter](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) ! you understand whereof you are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft; what say you to it? Speak the truth, and so you that are afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you will answer it before God another day. [Mary Walcot!](/tag/walcott_mary.html) doth this woman hurt you? A. I never saw her so as to be hurt by her. Q. [Mary Lewis!](/tag/lewis_mercy.html) does she hurt you? -- Her mouth was  stopped. -- Q.

Yes, Sir. -- Again, [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) and [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) were spoke to by the court, but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or other fits. Q. What do you say [Goody Procter](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q. [Ann Putman!](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) doth this woman hurt you. A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A. Yes, Sir, often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q. [Abigail Williams!](/tag/williams_abigail.html) does this woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to you? A. Yes. Q. What would she have you do with it? A. To write in it and I shall be well. -- Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had written? [(Procter)](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) Dear Child, it is not so. There is another judgement, dear child. -- Then [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) and [Ann](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) had fits. -- By and by they cried out, look you there is [Goody Procter](/tag/proctor_sarah.html) upon the beam. -- By and by, both of them cried out of [Goodman Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) himself, and said he was a wizard. -- Immediately, many, if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann Putman! who hurt you? A. [Goodman Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) and his wife too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is [Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) going to take up [Mrs. Pope's](/tag/pope_bathshua.html) feet. -- And her feet were immediately taken up. -- Q. What do you say [Goodman Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) to these things? A. I know not, I am innocent. -- [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) cried out, there is [Goodman Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) going to [Mrs. Pope](/tag/pope_bathshua.html) , and immediately, said [Pope](/tag/pope_bathshua.html) fell into a fit. -- You see the devil will deceive you; the children could see what you was going to do before the woman was hurt. I would advise you to repentance, for the devil is bringing you out. -- [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) cried out again, there is [Goodman Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) going to hurt [Goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html); and immediately [Goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html) fell into a fit. There was the like of [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) , and divers others. -- [Benjamin Gould](/tag/gould_benjamin.html) gave in his testimony, that he had seen [Goodman Corey](/tag/corey_giles.html) and his wife, [Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) and his wife, [Goody Cloyse](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) , [Goody Nurse](/tag/nurse_rebecca.html) , and [Goody Griggs](/tag/griggs_goody.html) in his chamber last thursday night. -- [Elizabeth Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) was in a trance during the whole examination. -- During the examination of [Elizabeth Procter](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) , [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) and [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) ,  both made offer to strike at said [Procter](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) ; but when [Abigail's](/tag/williams_abigail.html) hand came near, it opened, whereas it was made up into a fist before, and came done exceeding lightly, as it drew near to said [Procter](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) , and at length with open and extended fingers, touched [Procter's](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) hood very lightly. Immediately [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) cried out, her fingers, her fingers, burned, and [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) took on most greviously, of her head, and sunk down.

Salem, April 11th, 1692. [Mr. Samuel Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html) was desired by the honourable [Thomas Danforth](/tag/danforth_thomas.html) , deputy-governor, and the council, to take in writing the aforesaid examinations, and accordingly took and delivered them in; and upon hearing the same, and seeing what was then seen, together with the charge of the afflicted persons, were by the advice of the council all committed by us,
