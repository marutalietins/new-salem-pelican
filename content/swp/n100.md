# Fragment of the Examination of [Joan Penny](/tag/peney_joan.html)

[September 21, 1692]

She was bid to say the Lord's Prayer. When she came to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us, she said, so do I. No other mistake in saying the prayer, remarkable.

"A woman's examination, Sept. 21, 1692" as quoted in Thomas Hutchinson, The History of the Colony and Province of Massachusetts-Bay, 1767. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1936.), vol. II, p. 43n.
