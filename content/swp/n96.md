# (Examination of [Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) )

[(September 8, 1692) ]

The examination and confession (8. Sept. 92.)  of [Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) , wife of [Captain Osgood](/tag/osgood_john.html) of Andover, taken before [John Hawthorne](/tag/hathorn_john.html) and other their Majesties justices.

She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain time, she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet she thought was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which time she made a covenant with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger and that left a red spot: And that upon her signing, the devil told her he was her God, and that she should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she consented to it. She says further, that about two years agone, she was carried through the air, in company with [deacon Frye's wife](/tag/fry_eunice.html) , [Ebenezer Baker's wife](/tag/baker_ebenezer.html) , and [Goody Tyler](/tag/sprague_martha.html) , to five mile pond, where she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face in the water and made her renounce her former baptism, and told her she must be his, soul and body, forever, and that she must serve him, which she promised to do. She says, the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping, and that she was transported back again through the air, in company with the forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and believes they were carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As I said before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above. -- She confesses she has afflicted three persons, [John Sawdy](/tag/sawdy_john.html) , [Martha Sprague](/tag/sprague_martha.html) and [Rose Foster](/tag/foster_rose.html) , and that she did it by pinching her bed clothes, and giving consent the devil should do it in her shape, and that the devil could not do it without her consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court, by the glance of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to Salem to be  examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at Mr. Phillips's to refresh themselves, and the afflicted persons, being behind them upon the road, came up just as she was mounting again and were then afflicted, and cried out upon her, so that she was forced to stay until they were all past, and said she only looked that way towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she has lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She confesses further, that she herself, in company with [Goody Parker](/tag/parris_elizabeth.html) , [Goody Tyler](/tag/sprague_martha.html) , and Goody Dean , had a meeting at [Moses Tyler's](/tag/tyler_moses.html) house, last monday night, to afflict, and that she and Goody Dean carried the shape of Mr. Dean, the minister, between them, to make persons believe that Mr. Dean afflicted. Q. What hindered you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man stood before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie; notwithstanding, she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto put her hand. Her husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to be any way discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what she has said is true. -- When [Mistress Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) was first called, she afflicted [Martha Sprague](/tag/sprague_martha.html) and [Rose Foster](/tag/foster_rose.html) , by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out of their fits by the touch of her hand. [Mary Lacey](/tag/lacey_mary_sr.html) and [Betty Johnson](/tag/johnson_elizabeth_jr.html) and [Hannah Post](/tag/post_hannah.html) saw [Mistress Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) afflicting [Sprague](/tag/sprague_martha.html) and [Foster](/tag/foster_rose.html) . -- The said [Hannah Post](/tag/post_hannah.html) and [Mary Lacey](/tag/lacey_mary_sr.html) and [Betty Johnson, jun.](/tag/johnson_elizabeth_jr.html) and [Rose Foster](/tag/foster_rose.html) and [Mary Richardson](/tag/richardson_mary.html) were afflicted by [Mistress Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) , in the time of their examination, and recovered by her touching of their hands.

I underwritten, being appointed by authority, to take this examination, do testify upon oath, taken in court, that this is a true copy of the substance of it, to the best of my knowledge,  5 Jan1692 -- 3. The within [Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) was examined before their Majesties justices of the peace in Salem.

Attest. [John Higginson](/tag/higginson_john.html) , Just. Pac.

# ( Recantation of [Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) as Reported by [Rev. Increase Mather](/tag/mather_increase.html))

[(October 19, 1692) ]

Mrs. Osgood freely and relentingly said, that the confession which she made upon her examination for witchcraft, and afterwards acknowledged before the honourable judges, was wholly false, and that she was brought to the said confession by the violent urging and unreasonable pressings that were used toward her; she asserted that she never signed to the devill’s book, was never baptised by the devill, never afflicted any of the accusers, or gave her consent for their being afflicted. Being asked, why she prefixed a time and spake of her being baptised, &c.: about twelve years since; she replyed, and said, that when she had owned the thing, they asked the time; to which she answered, that she knew not the time; but being told that she did know the time and must tell the time, and the like; she considered that about twelve years before (when she had her last child) she had a fitt of sicknesse, and was melancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and accordingly did prefix the said time.

Being asked about the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed the devill appeared to her, &c. she replyed, that being told that the devill had appeared to her, and must needs appear to her, &c.; (she being a witch) she at length did own that the devill had appeared to her; and being press’d to say in what creature’s shape he appeared in, she at length did say, that it was in the shape of a cat; remembering that some time before her being apprehended, as she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &c.: not as though she any whitt suspected the said cat to be the devill in the day of *** but because some creature she must mention, and this came thus into her mind at that time.

# (Petition for [Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) , [Eunice Fry](/tag/fry_eunice.html) , [Deliverance Dane](/tag/dane_deliverence.html) , [Sarah Wilson, Sr.](/tag/wilds_sarah.html) , and [Abigail Barker](/tag/barker_abigail.html) )

[++ (January 3, 1693) ]

To the honoured court of Assize held at Salem, The humble address of several of the inhabitants of Andover. 

May it please this honoured court, 

We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to speak something at present are [Mrs. Mary Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) , [Eunice Frye](/tag/fry_eunice.html) , [Deliverance Dane](/tag/dane_deliverence.html) , [Sarah Wilson](/tag/wilds_sarah.html) and [Abigail Barker](/tag/barker_abigail.html) , who are women of whom we can truly give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members.

We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted, charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both  at home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of that evil that they are now charged with.
