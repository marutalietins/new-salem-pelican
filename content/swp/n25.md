# (Fragment of an Examination of [Richard Carrier](/tag/carrier_richard.html))

[July 22, 1692]

We met in a green, which was the minister's pasture - we were in two companies at last. I think there was a few men with them. - I heard [Sarah Good](/tag/good_sarah.html) talk of a minister or two. One of them was she that had been at the eastward; his name is [Burroughs](/tag/burroughs_george.html), and is a little man. -I remember not the other's name.
